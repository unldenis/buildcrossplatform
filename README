BuildCrossPlatform
===================
Utility that does cross platform build of a local project
in go.

I used this lib to generate the builds present in this
repository in the ./build folder. You can run one of
these or run 'go build'. At the moment there is no ios and
android because I don't have GCC in my environment.
